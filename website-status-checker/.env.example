# Example .env for website-status-checker
# Copy this file to .env and edit the values. Do NOT commit your real .env to source control.
#
# The script expects a single environment variable called URLS containing a comma-separated
# list of sites to check. Schemes (http:// or https://) are optional; if missing the
# script will prepend http:// by default.
#
# Examples:
# URLS=example.com, https://google.com, http://localhost:8000
# URLS=https://example.com
#
# Notes:
# - The app reads .env every run (or each loop iteration when using -i), so you can
#   update this file while the monitor is running and it will pick up changes.
# - Use full URLs when you need a specific scheme, port, or path.
# - No other variables are required by the current script.

URLS=example.com, https://google.com, http://localhost:8000
